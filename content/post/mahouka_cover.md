The EPUBs provided on the Mahouka Discord guild had some messed up metadata,
mainly the cover. Because I dislike ebooks without a cover in my ebook reader
I decided to fix the covers.

I do not take any credit for the ebooks themselves. Thanks koiL90, Toshiya and
Mttblue2 for your awesome work!

Here are my [fixed files](https://mega.nz/#F!dMJBjaqJ!oQKnl5Nv9VOFLjvSsmH-CQ).
